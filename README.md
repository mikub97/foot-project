# Real-Time Feet Pressure Visualization Dashboard

This project aims to visualize real-time and historical data of feet pressure measurements using Plotly Dash and MongoDB. The system records pressure data from six sensors on each foot, storing the measurements in a MongoDB database. The dashboard provides insights into the pressure distribution on the ground during walking activities, displaying both basic statistics and detailed graphical representations.
### Features:

1.Real-Time Visualization: The dashboard offers real-time updates of feet pressure measurements, allowing users to monitor pressure distribution as it happens.
2.Historical Data Analysis: Users can access historical data to analyze trends and patterns in feet pressure over time.
3.Basic Statistics: Display of basic statistics such as average pressure, peak pressure points, and pressure distribution across different foot areas.
4.Extensive Graphs: Detailed graphical representations, including line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps, to visualize pressure distribution and variations during walking activities.
